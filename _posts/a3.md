## SSAD Assignment 3

Overview:
------
The assignmemt will be in two parts.

1. Testing using Pytest and running tests with tox.
2. Code Inspections.

Pytest: 50 Points (40 for tests + 10 for tox)
---
Use your source file of Assignment 1 (i.e. Tetris game). Write testcases for all the classes implemented along with tests for functionality (Minimum **5** testcases).

#### Make sure you cover these cases
1. Write testcases for all the three classes you were asked to implement in Assignment 1.
    + example tests:
        + ```class Test_Block()```:  This class covers the functionality of the Block class implemented during the Assignment1.
        + Capture the movement or rotation of Block.
        + When the rotation key is pressed, the Block rotates accordingly. Write tests to verify the same.
2. ```setup.py``` and ```tox.ini``` files must be setup. These are required for setting up tox.

Note: Those who have not completed Assignment 1 properly are requested to fill up this form [here](http://google.com) by Saturday 15 October. You will be assigned a different code project, and you have to write test cases for the same.

Help : Follow the exact steps specified in the [setup.py](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html) and [tox.ini](http://codespeak.net/tox/example/pytest.html) and tox should be up and running.

Code Inspections: 50 Points (20 Self Review + 30 Other)
---
There are 50 code projects which will be assigned to students randomly (doc will be sent with allocations). The students are required to do a self review of their Assignment 1 and do a code review of the other project assigned to them.

Note: Those who have not completed Assignment 1 properly are requested to do a code review of the alloted code project in Part 1 of this Assignment. This will count as self review.

##### Code inspection consists of
+ Entering review comments within the tool provided to each of the group.
+ Find and report Bugs in the code written by students.
+ Find and report whether the required functionality of Tetris game is implemented or not.
+ Find and report the code smells with in the code written by students.
+ Find and report whether the code written by students satisfy the coding standards set by PEP-8.

## Format of the code inspection report

A total of two reports per student are to be submitted (1 report for self review and 1 for the other code project assigned to you) along with the review comments given on the tools provided.

Students are required to submit the reports only in document format(markdown, doc, txt- only if the tables are properly indented). Not in PDF.

### Help : 
+ students can run [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) to find the code smells and code style issues.
+ [Pep-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
+ Students can also refer to [message codes](http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/all-messages) and find similar bugs in the Tetris code / code project you're reviewing.
+ Instructions to use the pylint:
    + ``` sudo apt-get install pylint```
    +  ```pylint <python files> ```
