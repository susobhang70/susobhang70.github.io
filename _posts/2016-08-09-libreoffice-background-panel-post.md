LibreOffice 5.2 is out, and one of the key improvements to Impress and Draw has been the introduction of the Background Panels to the sidebar - namely Slide Background Panel for Impress, and Page Background Panel for Draw.

Both these panels have the same underlying code, and only differ in labels depending on the Application Context.
